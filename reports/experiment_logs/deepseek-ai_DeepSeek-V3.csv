spatial_reasoning,A 5x5x5 cube is painted on all exterior faces and then cut into 1x1x1 smaller cubes. How many of these smaller cubes have exactly one painted face?,Spatial reasoning and combinatorial geometry assessment: Calculate the count of sub-cubes with a specific number of painted faces from a larger dissected cube.,"Error: FP8 quantized models is only supported on GPUs with compute capability >= 8.9 (e.g 4090/H100), actual = `8.0`","Imagine a big 5x5x5 cube painted blue all over, then cut into 1x1x1 little cubes.
