* `data` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. 

**Explanation:**

The `pop(index)` method in Python removes the element at the specified index from the list and returns it. In this case, `pop(2)` removes the element at index 2 (which is `3`) and returns it. This modification also changes the original list `data`.



Let me know if you'd like to explore other data structure operations or have any more questions!","Python list question: If `data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, what does `data.pop(2)` give you, and what's `data` look like then?","Here's the breakdown:

* **`data.pop(2)`**

   - The `pop()` method removes and returns an element from a list.
   - The argument `2` specifies the index of the element to remove (remember, Python uses zero-based indexing).  

   - So, `data.pop(2)` removes the element at index 2, which is `3`. It returns `3`.

* **`data` after the pop**

   - After removing the element at index 2, the list `data` shifts its elements to the left.",0,0,0,0.9861111111111112,0.6770564411795991,0

Choosing a suboptimal search strategy in large datasets can incur massive computational costs.

**Identify and justify the optimal search algorithm**: If you wanted to quickly check if a specific item exists in a very large *sorted* list, what algorithm would you use and why?","**Explain your reasoning**:

The ideal algorithm for this scenario is **binary search**. Here's why:

* **Efficiency:** Binary search operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  At each step, it compares the middle element of the interval with the target value. If they match, the search is successful. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half. This halving process significantly reduces the search space with each comparison.
