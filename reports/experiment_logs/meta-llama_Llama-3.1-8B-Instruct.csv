spatial_reasoning,A 5x5x5 cube is painted on all exterior faces and then cut into 1x1x1 smaller cubes. How many of these smaller cubes have exactly one painted face?,Spatial reasoning and combinatorial geometry assessment: Calculate the count of sub-cubes with a specific number of painted faces from a larger dissected cube.,"The solution is: 

            ```python
import math

def count_sub_cubes_with_one_painted_face():
    # Total number of smaller cubes
    total_cubes = 5**3
    
    # Number of smaller cubes with one painted face (corner cubes)
    corner_cubes = 8
    
    # Number of smaller cubes with one painted face (edge cubes)
    edge_cubes = 12 * 4
    
    # Total number of smaller cubes with one painted face
    total_one_painted_face = corner_cubes + edge_cubes

## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find out how many of the 1x1x1 little cubes have only one blue side after a 5x5x5 cube painted blue all over is cut into them.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of small cubes
Since the big cube is 5x5x5, when cut into 1x1x1 cubes, the",0,0,0,1.1538461538461537,0.23535811626699799,0
logical_reasoning,"If 'all bachelors are unmarried' is true, and 'John is a bachelor' is true, can we conclude 'John is unmarried'?",Formal logical reasoning assessment: Evaluate the given premises and determine if the conclusion necessarily follows. Your response will be graded on accuracy.,"The conclusion necessarily follows.           

Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism. The first premise states that all bachelors are unmarried, which is a universal statement. The second premise states that John is a bachelor, which is an instance of the first premise. Since John is a bachelor, and all bachelors are unmarried, it logically follows that John is unmarried. This is a valid deductive argument, and the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. 

Note: The key to this question is understanding the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. The conclusion is not a statement about all bachel","Hey, quick logic check: If all bachelors are unmarried, and John is a bachelor, does that mean John is unmarried?","Yes, it logically follows that John is unmarried.",0,0,0,0.08,0.31736456185092643,0
